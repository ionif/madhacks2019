Sustainability has been an issue for a long time, people have tried various different solutions, this project aims to help with sustainability by helping college students reuse items that they do not need. Using a very simple interface, people need to simply take a picture of their item and post a location for anyone to claim within a specified time. In order to prevent irrelevant items to be posted on our application, we built an AI system that will filter through users' pictures to determine if it is acceptable on our application.
